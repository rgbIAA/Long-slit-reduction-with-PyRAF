The file "nightlog_2005-07-08.txt" is the example log file of observations for the tutorial. 

The FITS files used in the tutorial are not included in this repository. 

The functions and scripts are meant to be adapted (rewritten) to your paticular circumstances.

# Dependences

The tutorial require these packages to be installed in order to run:

+ numpy
+ astropy

For IRAF/PyRAF I recommend the [astroconda](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.
