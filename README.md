The file "nightlog_2005-07-08.txt" is the log file example of the observations used in the tutorial. 

The FITS files used are not included in this repository. 

The functions and scripts are meant to be adapted (rewritten) to your paticular circumstances.

# Dependences

The tutorial require these packages to be installed in order to run:

+ numpy
+ astropy
+ IRAF/PyRAF

For IRAF/PyRAF I recommend the [astroconda](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package (with [astroconda with PyRAF
](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#legacy-software-stack-with-iraf))
